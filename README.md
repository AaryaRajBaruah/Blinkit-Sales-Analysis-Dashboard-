# **End-to-End Blinkit Retail Analytics: SQL, Excel, Python & Power BI Dashboards**

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing vendor efficiency and profitability in a retail inventory and sales environment. Using **SQL**, **Excel**, **Python**, and **Power BI**, the objective was to uncover cost-saving opportunities, optimize purchasing strategies, and support data-driven decision-making for inventory management.

## ðŸ§° Tools & Technologies Used

* **SQL** â€“ Data extraction, transformation, and aggregation using advanced queries, CTEs, and filtering.
* **Excel** â€“ Data cleaning, validation, and preliminary analysis using formulas, PivotTables, and charts.
* **Python** â€“ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), hypothesis testing, and insights generation.
* **Power BI** â€“ Dashboard development for data visualization and business intelligence.

## ðŸ“Œ Key Objectives

* Assess vendor performance and profitability.
* Identify underperforming vendors and optimize inventory.
* Provide actionable insights to reduce costs and enhance supply chain efficiency.

## ðŸš€ What I Did

1. **SQL Data Preparation**

   * Developed complex SQL queries to merge and summarize data from multiple tables.
   * Improved performance using Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and optimized filters for large datasets.

2. **Excel Preprocessing & Analysis**

   * Used Excel for initial data cleaning, formatting, and quick checks before feeding into Python and Power BI.
   * Applied formulas, filters, and PivotTables to verify trends and summarize key metrics.

3. **Data Analysis & Hypothesis Testing (Python)**

   * Conducted EDA and statistical analysis to evaluate:

     * Vendor profitability
     * Inventory turnover
     * Effectiveness of pricing strategies

4. **Dashboard Development (Excel & Power BI)**

   * Created dashboards in **Power BI** and **Excel** to visualize:

     * Vendor-wise sales and profits
     * Inventory volume and value trends
     * Bulk purchasing impact on cost (identified a **72% cost reduction**)

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights

* **65.7%** of purchases were over-dependent on the top 10 vendors.
* Discovered **\$2.71M** in unsold inventory from low-performing vendors.
* Recommendation: Diversify vendor selection and optimize purchasing to reduce overstock and improve turnover.
* Actionable dashboards in **Excel** and **Power BI** helped stakeholders quickly identify procurement inefficiencies.
